<p><h2>North America Blockchain in Digital Rights Management (DRM) Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The increasing demand for secure and transparent content protection solutions is a key driver for the growth of blockchain technology in Digital Rights Management (DRM) in North America. Blockchain offers an immutable and decentralized ledger, making it ideal for safeguarding intellectual property and preventing unauthorized access or distribution. As industries like entertainment, publishing, and software rely heavily on DRM to protect copyrighted material, blockchain’s ability to enhance security and streamline royalty payments is gaining traction. This has led to greater adoption among content creators, distributors, and end-users, driving market expansion in the region.</p><p>Another significant trend in the North American blockchain-based DRM market is the rising need for interoperability between different DRM systems. As the media and entertainment sectors evolve, content is increasingly distributed across various platforms and devices, requiring seamless integration of DRM solutions. Blockchain offers the potential for greater interoperability, enabling rights holders to manage their assets across multiple platforms with ease. Moreover, the shift toward decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts is reshaping how digital rights are controlled and enforced, opening new opportunities for blockchain in the DRM space. These technological advancements are expected to fuel further growth in the market.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=90222&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=253" target="_blank">North AmericaBlockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaBlockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Blockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 6.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.8% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaBlockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Sony</Li><Li> Binded.Inc</Li><Li> Custos Media Technologies</Li><Li> Scenarex</Li><Li> Publica</Li><Li> Mediachain</Li><Li> Pixsy</Li><Li> Gilgamesh</Li><Li> RecordsKeeper</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaBlockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaBlockchain in Digital Rights Management DRM Market apart.
